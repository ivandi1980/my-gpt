# My GPT

## Description

Build a ChatGPT clone with HTMX, Spring Boot and Spring AI.
HTMX allows you to add dynamic behavior to your frontend without having to write JavaScript. Spring AI allows you to
easily build intelligent applications with generative AI. In this application you will use OpenAI's GPT-4o but you could
easily replace that with your Large Language Model (LLM) of choice.
